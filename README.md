My first idea was to parse the genre from movies and when the movie of the genre would came, then 
the category would be created and after that, movie would saved into heap.
But I after founding how many categories exists, I decide create whole structure of categories
and after that going through the file of movies and save specific movies into that categories based on
their rating.
I also thinks about adding function which user shows basic overview of the movie, if wants to.
